            <h4 style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px;">Shree Gouriya Baishnab Sammilani is the brain-child of
                Prabhupoad Atul Krishna Goswami. In 1318 B.S., on the
                1st of Baishakh, the idea was mooted out at the house
                of Sri Atul Krishna in the Presence of Sri Paresh Chandra
                Dutta, Vakil, Howrah and of Sri Bamacharan Basu,
                Inspector of Cassimbazar Estate. This was later on
                supported by Rai Jatinadra Nath Choudhury of
                Baranagar, Sri Motilal Ghosh, Editor, Ananda Bazar
                Patrika and Pandit Sri Rashik Mohan Vidyabhusan,
                Maharaja Sri Manindra Chandra Nundy Showed keen
                interest in the idea. The idea took a concrete shape on
                the 14th Baisakh, 1318 B.S. at the Cassimbazar Rajbati at
                302, Upper Chrcular Road (now Acharya Jagadish
                Chandra Bose Road). The Sammilani came into being on
                that auspicious day. Since then the Sammilani has been
                surved by many illustrious sons of Bengal. They are Sri
                Paresh Chandra Dutta, M.A. N.L., Sri Balailal Mallick,
                Prof. Dr. Bhagabat Kumar Shanstri, Rai Bahadur Rasomay

                Maharaji Manindra Chandra Nundy donated Rs.12,000/-
                for buying a piede o land for the Samilani. Sri Netai
                Charan Laha constructed the Nat Mandir at a cost of Rs.
                12,000/-, Sri Haridas Nundy donated nearly Rs.10,000/-
                for the building of Sree Mandir. Sree Mandir ws built in
                1340 B.S. and Sree Sree Radha-Govinda Jew Sree Sree
                Gour-Netai, and Sree Sree Sreedhan Jew were installed
                in the year. Advent of Sri Sri Radharani has a history. Mr.
                G.D. Scott of 6, Mango Lane narrates the history as
                follows on 31.3.33 (A.C.). ìThe Idol was given to my wife
                by a Mohommedan Curio Dealer in Asansol just before
                we left for England 9n 1919. We had no idea that..</h4>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px;">It was an Idol or had my religious significance. It was sent
            to England with some other items of interest and
            reached there in January 1920. My wife came out in the
            cold weather of 1920 on what was to have been a short
            holiday, but circumstances prevented her from returning
            to England as arranged, and the idol was sent back of
            India again. It arrived in India as far as I can remember
            about October or November, 1921. It was put in or drawing room as an ordinary curio. In 1924 we were
            informed that what we had taken to be a curio was in
            reality an Idol and that it must have been taken from
            some temple. As we did not like the idea of retaining
            anything of this nature in the house, I took it to the
            office, with the idea of finding someone who could
            restore it to its proper place. Mr. A.N. Laha took it but
            returned it a few days later as I believed, it had brought
            him bad luck. It was then given to Mr. Basanta Kumar
            Chatterjee and I was informed by him two or two or
            three years later that he had made proper arrangements
            for it to be put into a temple or some religious
            institution. I do not think I saw Mr. Chatterjee again until
            the 17th of this month when he informed me of the
            present position and arrangement made for the final
            disposal of the idol. At his request I went down to your
            Sammilani on the evening 18th of this month, when I
            saw the Idol again for the first time after about 8 or 9
            years.î
            Sree Sammilani has a Library and Reading Room. Rai
            Bahadur Nagendra Nath Dutta donated Rs.5,000/- for the
            construction of the Library and Reading Room. The Library
            owes its origin to Sri Atul Krishna Goswami who made over
            all his books to Sree Sammilani. The Library was opened
            by M.M. Haraprasad Shastri in 1334 B.S. on the 4th of
            Ashar, Prof. Phanibhusan Mukhopadhya M.A. was the first
            Librarian. The other Librarians of subsequent years were Sri Swarupdas Babaji, Rai Bahadur Nagendra Nath
            Dutta,
            Dr. Jnanendra Nath Sinha, M.D., Sri Jatindra Nath
            Bhattacharjee, M.A. Tathvaratnaker, Prof. Amulya Chandra
            Aikat, Dr. Kalikindar Sen Gupta, Pandit Anadi Mohan
            Goswami, Sri Ramendra Nath Bose, Sri Manindra Nath
            Aharya and others. The Library has more then 2500 books
            and 200 manuscripts.

        <h4 style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px;">The Sammilani was its own Journal ìGOURANGA SEVAKî.
            The first editor was late Prof. Lalitmohan Bandhapadhya.
            The other Editor of subsequent years were Pandit Rashik
            Mohan Vidyabhusan, Pandit Amulya Charan Vidyabhusan
            and Prof. Krishna Gopal Goswami, Asuthosh Professor of
            Sanskrit, Calcutta University. This is regretted that owing
            to several constraints, the journal could not be published
            for a consdiderble time till date.
            Sree Sammilani has published 27 books books on
            Vaishnavisam. The most important books are ìBhaktimalî,

            During the communal riots of 1946 ñ 1947 and during the
            consequent exodus of Hindus from east Bengal, Sree
            Sammilani gave shelter to hundreds of regugees from East
            Bangal and fed them for about a year. Sree Sammilani has
            Sri Gourangha Chatuspathi for the Spread of Sanskrit education.
